<h4>About</h4>

<p>This site has been a long-time-coming.  I&#39;ve dabbled in Wordpress a bit before and could never seem to find an effecient theme or web host.  During my Ph.D. program at Baylor Univeristy I began experimenting with GitHub.  I learned about GitHub Pages and quickly realized the potential for publishing flexible, creative, and user-designed content.</p>

<p>I really like the content-focused delivery of Jekyll.  I wanted the ability to write posts and author content in Markdown, push it all to GitHub, while avoiding so-called blogging software.</p>

<p>I came across Jonathan McGlone&#39;s site after browsing through a few examples powered by Jekyll.  I really liked the minimal style and format.  So much so that I decided to fork his repo and customize it to suit my needs.  Thanks, Jonathan!</p>
