<h3>About This Site</h3>

<p>This site has been a long-time-coming.  I&#39;ve dabbled in Wordpress a bit before and could never seem to find an effecient theme or web host.  During my <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/soe/edp/index.php?id=65264">Ph.D. program</a> at <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/">Baylor Univeristy</a> I began experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.  I learned about <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and quickly realized the potential for publishing flexible, creative, and user-designed content.</p>

<p>From there, it was on to locate the best framework.  I tend to prefer minimal designs so I was initially drawn to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.  After having a little difficulty deploying a hybrid blog/static site with Bootstrap I came across <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">JekyllBootsrap</a>.  I really like the content-focused delivery of Jekyll.  I wanted the ability to write posts and author content in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> via <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, push it all to GitHub, all while avoiding so-called blogging software.</p>

<p>Finally, I came across <a href="http://jmcglone.com/">Jonathan McGlone&#39;s site</a> after browsing through <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites">a few examples powered by Jekyll</a>.  I really liked the minimal style and format&ndash;so much so that I decided to fork his <a href="https://github.com/jmcglone">repo</a> and customize it to suit my needs.  Thanks, Jonathan!  In other words, since he licensed <a href="http://jmcglone.com/">jmcglone.com</a> under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a> I was able to treat Jonathan&#39;s site as a template.  If you&#39;re so inclined, feel free to do the same. </p>
