# Welcome to swirl!

Whether you're new to swirl, a veteran of our courses, or a swirl course developer yourself, thanks for checking out our brand new blog. Development of swirl is entering a new and exciting phase and we want to keep all of you up to date. We're working on fresh batches of courses, better documentation for writing your own courses, new ways of distributing courses, and tools to make using swirl in the classroom a no-brainer. All of these updates will be announced and detailed in posts to this blog.

We're committed to nourishing our student and course developer communities, so we've added [Disqus](https://disqus.com/){:target="_blank"} comments to all of these posts and we look forward to the discussions they foster! The swirl package has been downloaded [over a quarter million times](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/swirl) and we can't wait for the next quarter million!
