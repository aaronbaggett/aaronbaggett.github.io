I'm originally from [Levelland, TX](http://www.ci.levelland.tx.us).  There's even a not-so-flattering [song](http://youtu.be/L-D824LHti4) by James McMurtry about my hometown.  My wife, [Lisa R. Baggett, M.D.](http://healthcare-professionals.sw.org/graduate-medical-education/residencies/anesthesiology/resident?resID=2351) is a resident in anesthesiology at Scott & White Hospital in Temple.  Our first baby, a girl named Rhett Elisabeth was born in December 2013!  In my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter, playing golf, and umpiring Texas high school baseball.

I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, TX in religion/psychology and counseling psychology and human development, respectively.

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in educational psychology at Baylor University in Waco, TX.  My concentrations were in measurement & statistics and learning & development.
