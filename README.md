I'm originally from [Levelland, TX](http://www.ci.levelland.tx.us).  There's even a not-so-flattering [song](http://youtu.be/L-D824LHti4) by James McMurtry about my hometown.  My wife, [Lisa R. Baggett, M.D.](http://healthcare-professionals.sw.org/graduate-medical-education/residencies/anesthesiology/resident?resID=2351) is a resident in anesthesiology at Scott & White Hospital in Temple.  Our first baby, a girl named Rhett Elisabeth was born in December 2013!  In my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter, playing golf, and umpiring Texas high school baseball.

I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, TX in religion/psychology and counseling psychology and human development, respectively.

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in educational psychology at Baylor University in Waco, TX.  My concentrations were in measurement & statistics and learning & development.

### Dissertation

Information about my dissertation, tentatively titled:

*Perceptual-Cognitive Skills and Domain-Specific Expertise among Professional Baseball Umpires: A Quantitative Analysis of Ball-Strike Judgment and Decision Making*

is below:

#### Background

I'll be using PITCHf/x data from the 2011 Major League Baseball (MLB) season to estimate umpires' ability to distinguish pitches which cross the front edge of home plate within a given batter's unique strike zone from those that do not enter the strike zone.  What distinguishes this project from the the work of others (e.g., [MacMahon & Starkes (2010)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18409106), [Fast (2007)](http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=14572), and [Mills (2013a](http://princeofslides.blogspot.com/), [2013b](http://jse.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/05/02/1527002513487740), and [2013c](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mde.2630/abstract)) is the theoretical foundation--which is rooted mainly in the educational, cognitive, and sport psychology traditions.

#### Methodology

The data are arranged in a hierarchical format with pitch-level information at level one and umpire-level information at level two.  The umpire's decision on the location of each pitch is treated as a binary outcome variable (1 = correct; 0 = incorrect) in a generalized linear mixed model.

Level one predictor variables include:
```
Pitch location (1 of 9 strike zone regions; 1 of 4 ball zone regions)
Pitch count (0-0, 0-1, ..., 3-2)
```

Level two predictor variables include:
```
Umpire experience (in seasons)
Aggregated umpire postseason experience (in number of series assigned)
```
