I've always been curious to hear about the tools other people use in their work.  So, when I came across [The Setup Interviews](http://usesthis.com/) from [usethis.com](http://usesthis.com/about/) I was excited to learn about the hardware, software, and other equipment academics use.  Below are some of my favorites:

* [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.wickham.usesthis.com/)
* [Julie Ann Horvath](http://julie.ann.horvath.usesthis.com/)
* [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.xie.usesthis.com/)

The probability is extremely low that I will be asked to submit an interview for The Setup, but in case they ask, or you were wondering, here is mine.

### Who are you, and what do you do?
I'm an instructor in the Department of Psychology at the [University of Mary Hardin-Baylor](http://www.umhb.edu/) (UMHB) in Belton, TX.  I teach mostly undergraduate courses in research methods, statistics for the social sciences, and experimental psychology.  Although, in the fall, I will be teaching a course on the social psychology of religion.  I expect to finish my Ph.D. in [educational psychology](http://www.baylor.edu/soe/edp/index.php?id=65264) from [Baylor University](http://www.baylor.edu/) in August 2014.  My research interests are mainly rooted in the application of cognitive psychology to sport performance and the development of statistical models to estimate expertise in ball--strike judgment and decision making among [Major League Baseball umpires](http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/).

### What hardware do you use?
I use a 15" MacBook Pro Retina, 2.6 GHz, 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD.  While in my office at UMHB I dock my MacBook on a [twelvesouth HiRise](http://www.twelvesouth.com/product/hirise-for-macbook) with an Apple USB keyboard, Magic Mouse, and SuperDrive.  I also use a 500GB SanDisk external HD for Time Machine backups.  My wife and I also have a mid-2010 21.5" iMac at home.  I have an iPhone 5s with the little black leather case.

### And what software?
I'm currently running [OS X 10.9.2](https://www.apple.com/osx/).  I occasionally use [Cinch](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/) to split different apps on my screen.  I live in [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) for data analysis and document markup.  [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is a blessing.  I'm compiling my dissertation in [LaTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) with a class modified by my advisor, [Alex Beaujean](https://blogs.baylor.edu/alex_beaujean/latex/).  For my undergraduate statistics course we do all data analysis in SPSS.  I know, I know.  I've grown to prefer Apple Preview over Adobe Acrobat.

I'm a staunch [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) user.  I sync files and back up documents in [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/).  I used SugarSync for a while, but Dropbox works much more seamlessly.  iCloud is a disappointment.  I read mail and manage my calendars in Outlook.  I know, I know.  I also prefer PowerPoint for slides over Keynote.  I've thought about migrating to Beamer, but the themes are weak and I don't have time to make my own.  I use [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) to produce video tutorials for my classes.  I pretty much always have [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) open.  When I need to edit or produce graphics I use [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/).

### What would be your dream setup?
I would love to have 8 more GB of ram in my MacBook Pro and a [Dell 4k display](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/12/02/24-inch-4k-display-from-dell-priced-at-1399-28-inch-4k-model-coming-at-under-1000/) at work.  Some [Beats Studio wireless headphones](http://www.beatsbydre.com/headphones/studio-wireless/titanium/900-00199-01.html) would be nice, too.  Although the reviews may not be stellar, I would love to have an [Apple Time Capsule](http://www.apple.com/airport-time-capsule/) at home to double as a Wi-Fi base station while backing up all my work wirelessly.
