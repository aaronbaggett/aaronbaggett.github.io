I've always been curious to hear about the tools other people use


### Who are you, and what do you do?
I'm an instructor in the Department of Psychology at the Univeristy of Mary Hardin-Baylor in Belton, TX.  I teach mostly undergraduate courses in research methods, statistics for the social sciences, and experimental psychology.  Although, in the fall, I will be teaching a course on the social psychology of religion.  I expect to finish my Ph.D. in educational psychology from Baylor University in August 2014.  My research interests tend to vary between the application of cognitive psychology to sport performance and the effects of religious fundamentalism on the perceptions of social norms.

### What hardware do you use?
At work I use a 15" MacBook Pro Retina, 2.6 GHz, 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD.  At home I use a mid-2010 21.5" iMac.

### And what software?
Text

### What would be your dream setup?
When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this.
